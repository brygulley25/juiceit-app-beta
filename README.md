# JuiceIT - Personalized Juice Recipe App

## 📱 App Size Optimization

### Current Status
- **Development size**: ~500MB+ (normal for React Native projects)
- **Expected final app size**: 15-25MB
- **Target for beta**: <50MB

### Size Analysis Commands
```bash
# Analyze current project size
npm run analyze

# Run optimization checks
npm run optimize

# Check final build size
npm run size-check
```

### Optimization Checklist

#### ✅ Already Optimized
- Using Expo managed workflow (smaller than bare React Native)
- Minimal dependencies (only essential packages)
- No large media files in bundle
- Tree-shaking enabled by default

#### 🔄 Safe Optimizations Available
- [ ] Enable Proguard for Android (added to app.json)
- [ ] Enable resource shrinking (added to app.json)
- [ ] Remove unused imports
- [ ] Optimize image assets

#### ⚠️ Advanced Optimizations (Higher Risk)
- [ ] Code splitting for large components
- [ ] Lazy loading for non-critical features
- [ ] Bundle splitting for web platform

### Platform Limits
- **iOS App Store**: 4GB download limit
- **Google Play**: 150MB base APK + expansion files
- **TestFlight (Beta)**: 4GB limit
- **Internal Distribution**: No strict limits

### Beta Distribution
Your current app should be well within beta distribution limits. The large development folder size won't affect beta testers.

## 🚀 Build Commands

```bash
# Development
npm run dev

# Production build
npm run build:web

# Size analysis
npm run analyze
```

## 📊 Size Monitoring

Run `npm run analyze` regularly to monitor:
- Bundle size trends
- Dependency impact
- Asset optimization opportunities
